# MOD-release-evidence Versions, release candidates, the release test report, the release and its audit

## Responsibility

It belongs to Tests and releases (ARC-043). It gives each product its own calendar version line (`CALENDAR VERSIONS`,
`EVERY PRODUCT HAS ITS OWN VERSION LINE`), marks a release candidate and starts the complete run on it (`A RELEASE RUNS
EVERY TEST AT EVERY LEVEL`), composes the release test report from the result records, tells which reports wait for that
acceptance (`A PERSON IS TOLD WHAT WAITS FOR THEIR ACCEPTANCE`), and releases when a person accepts the report: the
report, its approval record with every known limitation and the changelog entry in one commit, then the tag on the
tested commit (`THE RELEASE TEST REPORT IS ACCEPTED BY A PERSON`, `ACCEPTING THE RELEASE TEST REPORT RELEASES`, `A RED
RELEASE IS ACCEPTED ONLY WITH ITS LIMITATIONS RECORDED`, `A RELEASE IS TAGGED AND LOGGED`). It derives the audit of a
release and its export (`THE AUDIT VIEW LISTS EVERY REQUIREMENT OF THE RELEASE`). A released version is never re-tagged
(`A VERSION IS NOT REWRITTEN`). It runs in the browser and in Node.

## Parts

- `index.mjs` — the interface.
- `version.mjs` — the next version and the tags of a product's line.
- `candidate.mjs` — the release candidate and its complete run.
- `report.mjs` — the release test report, the reports that wait for acceptance, and releasing on its acceptance.
- `audit.mjs` — the audit rows, their summary and the export.

## Data

It keeps nothing. It owns three formats.

**The release test report**, `docs/tests/releases/v<YYYY.MINOR.PATCH>.md` — a reviewed file, accepted through an approval
record of kind `release-report`:

| Part | Content |
|---|---|
| front matter | `version`, `candidate` (the tag `v<version>-rc.<N>`), `commit` (the tested commit), `date` |
| `## Limitations` | first: every failing test and every rate worse than the last release's, each with the requirements it guards; empty when the run is green |
| `## Levels` | per level: passed, failed, flaky, not run |
| `## Tests` | every test: identifier, level, outcome or rate, the identifiers it guards |
| `## Requirements` | every requirement valid at the commit with the tests that guard it, by level — the evidence per requirement |
| `## Changelog entry` | the entry the person chose at *Start release candidate*, as it will stand in `CHANGELOG.md` |

**The changelog entry**, appended to `CHANGELOG.md`: a heading `## v<YYYY.MINOR.PATCH> — <YYYY-MM-DD>`, the entry's text
as the report holds it, and, for a release accepted with limitations, the list `Known limitations:` with each failing
test or worse rate and its reason.

**The audit document**, `docs/audits/<tag>.md` when a person commits it: the release tag and its commit SHA; the summary;
one row per requirement valid at the release — its name, what it constrains, its sources with authority, version and the
hashes of the version, the tests that guard it by level with their outcome or rate and their counter-proof, for a process
requirement the gate records and artifacts it added, and the acceptance of the report — who, when and the blob SHA of the
accepted text —; the blob SHAs of the report and of the approval records, so that every statement can be checked against
the repository without Agent M.

Tags of a product's line: `v<YYYY.MINOR.PATCH>` for a release, `v<YYYY.MINOR.PATCH>-rc.<N>` for its candidates.

## Interfaces

- `nextVersion(tags: string[], step: "minor" | "patch", today: string) -> string` — the next version of the product's own
  line: a minor step by default; in a new calendar year `YYYY.1.0`. Considers: tags of other products are never given.
- `startReleaseCandidate(host: Host, version: string, commit: string, changelog: string, person: string) -> Promise<{
  candidate: string, run: string }>` — tags the commit `v<version>-rc.<N>`, the next free `N`, and queues the complete
  run on it — every test at every level, model-dependent tests their fixed number of times, user-level tests as a
  checklist for the people assigned to them — as a job of kind `run-tests` through MOD-runtimes, whose parameters name
  the candidate — its version and tag — and keep the changelog entry the person chose, so that the candidate carries it
  to its report. Considers: release tests are run by a participant other than the one that implemented what they test;
  if only the implementer can run them, it says so (`RELEASE TESTS ARE NOT WRITTEN BY THE IMPLEMENTER`). Crosses the
  network. Errors: `TagExists`, `NoRunner` (no participant can run a level, named), `TokenRefused`, `PermissionMissing`,
  `RateLimited`, `Unreachable`.
- `releaseReport(at: Snapshot, results: Snapshot, candidate: { version: string, tag: string, commit: string, changelog:
  string }) -> { text: string, complete: boolean, failing: string[], worse: string[] }` — the release test report of a
  finished complete run, its `## Changelog entry` the one the candidate's run keeps among its parameters; `complete` is
  false while any test has not run on the candidate's commit, and then no tag can be set.
- `acceptAndRelease(host: Host, report: { path: string, blob: string }, decision: { limitations: Record<string, string>
  }, person: string, today: string) -> Promise<{ commit: string, tag: string }>` — on the person's one click, on the
  release panel or in the review list alike: commits the report, its approval record naming the report's blob and every
  limitation, and the changelog entry the report holds — the person is not asked for it again — together; then sets the
  tag `v<version>` on the tested commit, not on a later one. It refuses while a failing test or a worse rate has no
  recorded reason, while the report is incomplete, and when the tag exists — an existing tag is never moved. Crosses the
  network. Errors: `LimitationMissing` (naming the tests and rates), `Incomplete`, `TagExists`, `Moved`, `TokenRefused`,
  `PermissionMissing`, `RateLimited`, `Unreachable`.
- `reportsAwaitingAcceptance(host: Host, snapshot: Snapshot) -> Promise<{ version: string, candidate: string, record:
  string, blob: string } | null>` — the release test report that waits for a person's acceptance in one repository, if
  one does: that of the newest release candidate — the newest tag `v<version>-rc.<N>` — whose version has neither its
  release tag `v<version>` nor its report `docs/tests/releases/v<version>.md`, which `acceptAndRelease` writes only
  together with the report's approval record, once that candidate's complete run — the job of kind `run-tests` that
  `startReleaseCandidate` queued — has ended as done. It reads the tags once. Only while such a candidate is pending
  does it read job records: newest first, through MOD-job-ledger's `recordsNewestFirst`, and only up to the first run of
  a release candidate it meets: that candidate's run or, when that run was never recorded, an earlier candidate's — only
  for a first candidate whose run was never recorded does it read every record. `candidate` is the candidate's tag,
  `record` the path of its run's record and `blob` its blob, which no longer changes once the job has ended. Considers:
  the report itself is composed on the release panel by `releaseReport`; a candidate whose user-level tests are still
  being entered waits all the same, and the panel names what is missing. Crosses the network: the tags through the host,
  the records through the snapshot; fails with their errors — `TokenRefused`, `PermissionMissing`, `RateLimited`,
  `Unreachable` —, and with `NotSupported` through a host that does no server operations, such as a local clone.
- `auditRows(at: Snapshot, results: Snapshot, release: { tag: string, commit: string }, gates: Array<{ requirement: string,
  gate: string, record: string }>, instanceSpec: string) -> { summary: { passing: number, noTest: number, notPassed: number, flaky: number,
  worse: number, byImplementer: number, accepted: boolean, limitations: string[] }, rows: Array<{ requirement: string,
  constrains: "product" | "process", sources: Array<{ id: string, authority: string, version: string, hashes: string[] }>,
  tests: Array<{ id: string, level: string, outcome: string, counterProof: string | null }>, gates: string[] }> }` — one
  row per requirement valid at the release, a requirement without a test or without a passing outcome included and
  counted: each requirement of the product's SPEC at the release, which constrains the product, and each process
  requirement whose gate the product's workflow holds — a requirement of the instance's SPEC, `instanceSpec`, which
  constrains the development process (MOD-spec-document) — with its gate records. `gates` are those records, which the
  caller reads through Process, since Process lies above this subsystem. A release before Agent M's records says which parts cannot be derived.
- `auditDocument(audit: { summary: object, rows: object[] }, release: { tag: string, commit: string }) -> string` — the
  self-contained Markdown document of the audit; the browser saves it, and a person with write access may commit it to
  `docs/audits/<tag>.md`.

`Host` and `Snapshot` are MOD-repository-hosts'; `at` is the product at the release's commit, `results` its
branch `test-results`.

## Files

- Reads the product at the tagged commit — `SPEC.md`, `docs/sources.md`, the tests, the report, the approval records —,
  the branch `test-results`, the schedule, and the instance's source register and `SPEC.md`, whose requirements are the
  process requirements.
- Reads, for `reportsAwaitingAcceptance`, the tags, the default branch's `docs/tests/releases/`, and, only while a release
  candidate is pending, its `docs/jobs/` newest first back to the first run of a candidate.
- Writes `docs/tests/releases/v<version>.md`, `docs/approvals/release-v<version>-<blob12>.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, the tags
  `v<version>-rc.<N>` and `v<version>`, and, on a person's click, `docs/audits/<tag>.md`.
