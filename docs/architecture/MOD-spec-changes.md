# MOD-spec-changes SPEC change queues, from proposal to the accepted section

## Responsibility

It belongs to Specification and design (ARC-041). A SPEC is never written directly: every change to it is an entry of a
change queue under `docs/spec-freigaben/` — the whole section as proposed, beside the section it replaces — and is
written into the SPEC byte for byte, with its approval record and its decision, in one commit, only when a person
accepts it on the text that was shown (`A SPECIFICATION CHANGE IS APPROVED BEFORE IT IS WRITTEN`, `THE APPROVED TEXT IS
TAKEN VERBATIM`, `AN ACCEPTED SPEC CHANGE IS WRITTEN WITH ITS APPROVAL`). It keeps the person's edits in one open queue
of the day, writes drafted candidates as entries, applies approvals committed without a token for the instance's
workflow, and tells each requirement's history. It runs in the browser and in Node.

## Parts

- `index.mjs` — the interface.
- `queue-index.schema.md`, `queue-rationale.schema.md`, `queue-decisions.schema.md` — the schemas of a queue's files, in
  MOD-documents' schema language.
- `queues.mjs` — reading queues and the state of each entry.
- `propose.mjs` — writing an entry into the person's open queue, and the writer of classified candidates.
- `accept.mjs` — accepting entries in their queue's order, and applying approvals without a token.
- `history.mjs` — the history of a requirement.
- `strategies.mjs` — the recipes and writer of `specStrategies`.

## Data

It keeps nothing. It owns the change queue; a queue is a folder `docs/spec-freigaben/<YYYY-MM-DD><letter>_<slug>/`,
the letter (`b`, `c`, …) distinguishing several queues of one day, absent for the first.

| File | Schema | Content |
|---|---|---|
| `index.md` | `queue-index` | the title line `# SPEC approvals — queue <folder date> · <title>`; free text: the decision taken and the impact analysis as a table of the names it changes or withdraws and what references them; the line `**Zieldatei aller Einträge:** ` with the target in backticks; and the entry table |
| `NN-<slug>.md` | — | an entry: the complete section as proposed, from its heading line to its end, nothing else; `NN` two digits |
| `NN-<slug>.begruendung.md` | `queue-rationale` | the title line `# <section>: <what changes>`, the paragraphs **The change.** and **Why.**, the impact list, and the origin — the source passage and version, the instruction, or the issue —; for a drafted entry also the Agent M version, the participant, the model, the date and the correction rounds |
| `entscheidungen.md` | `queue-decisions` | the title line `# Decisions — queue <folder> <title>`, the line `Append-only.`, then one row per decision, appended, never changed |

The entry table of `index.md`, a register with exactly these columns:

```text
| Nr | Datei | Anker (Überschrift, wortgetreu) | bis (exklusiv) | Commits |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 01 | `SPEC.md` | ## 7. Configuration and secrets | — | — |
```

`Anker` is the heading line the section starts with, verbatim; `bis (exklusiv)` an end heading where the section ends
before another heading than the next one of its level, `—` otherwise; `Commits` is `—`.

A row of `entscheidungen.md`, a register without a header row:

```text
| 2026-09-23 21:47 UTC | 1 | uebernommen | approval:spec-2026-09-23d_instanz-und-token-01-47a9e8a383b0.md |
```

The state of an entry, derived and never written: `open` — no approval record names its proposal; `approved` — a record
names the proposal's current blob and no decision row names the record yet (the instance's workflow has still to write
it); `in SPEC` — a decision row `uebernommen` names its record; `stale` — a record or the reviewer's view names a proposal
or SPEC section whose blob is no longer current; `waiting for its anchor` — its anchor is not in the target, and an
earlier entry of the queue creates it.

## Interfaces

- `Queue` — `{ folder: string, title: string, target: string, entries: Array<{ number: number, file: string,
  anchor: string, until: string | null, proposal: { path: string, blob: string }, rationale: string,
  record: string | null, decision: string | null, state: "open" | "approved" | "in SPEC" | "stale" |
  "waiting for its anchor", createdBy: number | null }> }`, where `createdBy` is the number of the entry whose proposal
  creates the anchor.
- `queues(snapshot: Snapshot) -> Queue[]` — every queue of a snapshot with every entry and its state, newest first.
- `openQueueOf(person: string, date: string, host: Host) -> Promise<string | null>` — the folder of the person's newest
  queue of that day that has no entry in SPEC yet, or `null` (`A PERSON'S EDITS COLLECT IN ONE OPEN QUEUE`). The person
  of a queue is the author of the commit that created its index. Crosses the network; fails with the host's errors.
- `proposeSection(host: Host, change: { target: string, anchor: string, until: string | null, text: string,
  why: string, origin: string, person: string, openedBlob: string }) -> Promise<{ commit: string, queue: string,
  entry: number, alsoReplacing: Array<{ queue: string, entry: number }> } | { refused: "changed meanwhile", current:
  string } | { fallback: Array<{ url: string, path: string, text: string, differs: boolean }> }>` — writes one edited
  section as an entry, in one commit under the person's account: into the person's open queue of the day, or a new
  queue; a second edit of the same section in that queue replaces its entry instead of adding one. The impact list of
  every requirement the edit changes, withdraws or adds is computed and written with the rationale (`A REQUIREMENT IS NOT
  CHANGED WITHOUT AN IMPACT LIST`); a changed name is proposed as the old name withdrawn and the new one added (`A RENAMED
  REQUIREMENT IS WITHDRAWN AND ADDED`); the target file is not touched (`A SPEC EDIT IS SAVED AS A PROPOSAL`). Refuses
  when the section's blob on the default branch differs from `openedBlob`, returning the newer text so that the caller
  keeps the edit beside it (`A SAVE IS REFUSED WHEN THE TEXT CHANGED MEANWHILE`, `A REFUSED SAVE KEEPS THE EDIT`).
  `alsoReplacing` names other open entries that replace the same section. Without a token on GitHub it writes nothing
  and returns GitHub's pages for each file of the entry; on GitLab without a token it refuses with `TokenRequired`.
  Considers: called only on a person's click. Crosses the network. Errors: `Moved`, `TokenRefused`,
  `PermissionMissing`, `RateLimited`, `Unreachable`, `TokenRequired`.
- `entryView(queue: string, entry: number, snapshot: Snapshot) -> { current: { text: string, blob: string } | null,
  proposal: { text: string, blob: string }, difference: LineDiff, rationale: string, impact: Array<{ name: string,
  change: "changed" | "withdrawn" | "added", referencedBy: string[] }>, state: string, createdBy: number | null }` —
  what the reviewer sees: the section that holds now beside the proposal, their difference, the rationale and the impact
  list (`NO PROPOSAL WITHOUT THE CURRENT TEXT BESIDE IT`). `LineDiff` is the result of MOD-text-tools' `lineDiff`.
- `acceptEntries(host: Host, shown: Array<{ queue: string, entry: number, proposalBlob: string, sectionBlob: string }>,
  person: string, now: Date, sources: { links: Document, register: Document[] }) -> Promise<{ commit: string } | {
  refused: Array<{ queue: string, entry: number, reason: string }> }>` — accepts the entries shown, in one commit under the person's account: for each, in the order of its
  queue's index, its approval record, the target's section replaced by the proposal byte for byte, and its decision row
  (`A QUEUE IS ACCEPTED IN ITS ORDER`). An entry whose anchor another entry creates is accepted only together with or
  after that entry. If any entry's proposal or section no longer has the blob that was shown, nothing is written and every
  such entry is named (`A STALE APPROVAL IS NOT APPLIED`). Nothing is written either while a requirement of a proposal
  names no source the product links: the entry is named with the requirement, from MOD-source-register's
  `sourceFindings` over the product's links and the instance's register in `sources` (`A REQUIREMENT HAS A REGISTERED
  SOURCE`). Considers: called only on a person's click; without a token,
  the record alone is committed through MOD-approvals' GitHub page and the instance's workflow writes the rest with
  `applyApproved`. Crosses the network. Errors: `Moved`, `TokenRefused`, `PermissionMissing`, `RateLimited`,
  `Unreachable`.
- `applyApproved(snapshot: Snapshot, now: Date) -> { files: Record<string, string>, applied: string[],
  refused: Array<{ record: string, reason: string }> }` — for every record of kind `spec` that no decision row names yet,
  in the order of its queue's index: checks that the proposal and the section still have the blobs the record names and
  that the record's anchor is the queue's anchor for that entry, and that every requirement of the proposal names a source
  the instance links in its `docs/sources.md`, from its register in `docs/sources/` (`A REQUIREMENT HAS A REGISTERED
  SOURCE`), and returns the target with the section replaced and the
  decision row appended. A record that fails a check changes nothing and is named. It writes nothing itself: the
  instance's workflow commits `files` (`WITHOUT A TOKEN, THE INSTANCE'S WORKFLOW WRITES THE CHANGE`).
- `requirementHistory(name: string, host: Host) -> Promise<Array<{ date: string, person: string, commit: string,
  record: string | null, before: string | null, after: string | null }>>` — every accepted change to the text of a
  requirement, oldest first: the date and person of the accepting commit, its record, and the requirement's text before
  and after; a section written before any record shows the commit that introduced it and `record: null` (`A REQUIREMENT
  SHOWS ITS HISTORY`). Crosses the network; fails with the host's errors.
- `specStrategies: Strategies` — the strategies this module offers the job runner (ARC-046):
  - recipe `spec-with-queues` — every requirement of the SPEC and of every open entry of every queue, each with its
    section and state (`DERIVATION SEES THE EXISTING REQUIREMENTS`);
  - recipe `whole-spec` — the SPEC as it stands, as one part;
  - recipe `named-requirements` — the requirements the job's parameters name, each with its whole section;
  - recipe `chosen-requirements` — the requirements the person chose; without a choice, every requirement of the SPEC
    that no use case realises;
  - writer `queue-entries` — writes classified candidates as a new queue of the SPEC each belongs in, where it stands
    being what it constrains (MOD-spec-document): a candidate classed as constraining the development process goes to a
    queue of the instance's SPEC, its class decided against that SPEC and its open queues as for the product's, every
    other candidate to a queue of the product's SPEC — one queue, and one commit, for each of the two that gets one. Within
    a queue, one entry per section the candidates touch: a `new`
    candidate added to its section; a `change` in the section of the requirement it changes, under its name
    (`A CHANGE IS PROPOSED UNDER THE EXISTING NAME`); a `duplicate` as an added source of the existing requirement
    (`A DUPLICATE ADDS A SOURCE, NOT A REQUIREMENT`); a `conflict` only as the person resolved it, an undecided one not at
    all (`A CONFLICT IS DECIDED BY A PERSON`). Each rationale names its origin and the impact list; the commit carries the
    provenance lines.

`Host` and `Snapshot` are MOD-repository-hosts'.

## Files

- Reads `docs/spec-freigaben/*/` — `index.md`, entries, rationales, `entscheidungen.md` —, `docs/approvals/spec-*.md`,
  the target of each queue (`SPEC.md`), and every artifact the trace graph needs for an impact list.
- Writes, in one commit each time: a new queue folder or a new entry with its rationale and index row; on acceptance,
  `docs/approvals/spec-<queue>-<NN>-<blob12>.md`, the target's section and a row of `entscheidungen.md`.

## Uses

- MOD-approvals.approvalSchema — the record of a SPEC entry is an approval record.
- MOD-artifact-edits.fallbackEditLinks — GitHub's pages for the files of an entry without a token.
- MOD-repository-hosts.Host, Snapshot, readSnapshot, readHistory, commitFiles — reading queues and the head, the author
  of a queue and the history of a requirement, and the one commit of a proposal or an acceptance.
- MOD-documents.Schema, Document, loadSchema, readDocument, writeDocument, readRegister, appendSection — the queue's files
  by their schemas, the links and register handed in, and the appended decision row; MOD-documents.classifyCandidates —
  the classes of process candidates against the instance's SPEC.
- MOD-spec-document.parseSpec, sectionText, replaceSection, requirementNamesIn, renamedRequirements — the requirements,
  a section's exact bytes and its replacement, the names an edit touches.
- MOD-trace-graph.traceGraph, requirementImpact, coverageGaps — impact lists, and the requirements no use case realises.
- MOD-source-register.sourceSchemas, sourceFindings — the instance's links and register as the workflow reads them, and
  the requirements that name no linked source.
- MOD-text-tools.Finding, finding, blobSha, lineDiff — findings, blob SHAs and the difference shown.
- MOD-job-runner.Strategies, JobContext, Part, JobResult, provenanceLines — the form of the strategies and the
  provenance of a drafted queue's commit.
