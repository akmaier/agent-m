# Agent M — Specification

**VERBINDLICH (SPEC)**

This is the single binding document of Agent M. A sentence belongs here when its violation would
be a defect. Everything else — how something is built, what was measured, what is planned —
belongs in `PLAN.md`, in `docs/measurements/`, or in the code, and does not bind.

**No section of this file is written by hand.** Each change is proposed in
`docs/spec-freigaben/<date>_<name>/`, shown on the review dashboard beside the text it would replace,
and written only when the Product Owner accepts it there (§10, `ACCEPTANCE IS A COMMIT BY THE
ACCEPTING PERSON`).

**Form of a requirement** (from `SOFTWARE_MAINTENANCE.md`, *"Wie eine Anforderung aussieht"*):
a **name** in capitals that is the ID and never changes, a **source with a date**, one **rule**
stated as a single testable sentence, an **occasion** of one or two lines, and the **check** that
guards it. One statement per requirement — an "and" in the rule means it is two.
