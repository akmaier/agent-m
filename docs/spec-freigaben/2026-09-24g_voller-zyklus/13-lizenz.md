## 0. Hard product rules

These five hold for every version of Agent M. A change to any of them is a change to what the
product is.

**NO SERVER** *(PO A. Maier, 2026-09-23)*
Agent M is delivered as a static site, repository conventions, and optional workflows; the project
operates no server, no account system and no database.
*Occasion:* a book companion that requires an account is a service, and a service that outlives
the reader's interest in it is a liability. GitHub Pages plus the reader's own repository has no
such tail.
*Check:* `tests/test_no_backend.py` — the built site contains no call to an origin other than the
configured endpoints, the repository servers of the instance and its products, the local bridge, and
the package registries and resource hosts the page names before it calls them.

**ARTIFACTS ARE MARKDOWN** *(Vibe Coding, ch. 9 §6)*
Every artifact Agent M produces is Markdown, with diagrams written as Mermaid inside it.
*Occasion:* text-first artifacts can be versioned, diffed in a pull request, and read by both a
person and a model. Binary diagram formats break all three at once.
*Check:* `tests/test_artifact_format.py`

**NO SECRET IN THE REPOSITORY** *(PO A. Maier, 2026-09-23)*
No API key, access token or endpoint credential is written into a repository managed by Agent M.
*Occasion:* the reader's key is their own. A tool that can leak it into a public repository has
one failure mode too many, and the failure is not recoverable by deleting the commit.
*Check:* `tests/test_no_secret_written.py` — a generated artifact containing a configured secret
value fails the run.

**THE PRODUCT REPOSITORY IS SELF-SUFFICIENT** *(PO A. Maier, 2026-09-23)*
Removing Agent M leaves a complete, readable set of artifacts behind in the product repository.
*Occasion:* lock-in is the usual price of a workflow tool. Here it can be avoided for free,
because the artifacts were going to be Markdown anyway — so it is stated as a rule rather than
left to good intentions.
*Check:* `tests/test_self_sufficient.py` — no artifact references a file or service that exists
only inside Agent M.

**AGENT M IS MIT-LICENSED** *(PO A. Maier, 2026-09-24)*
Agent M is published under the MIT licence, stated in a `LICENSE` file at the root of its repository.
*Occasion:* PO, 2026-09-24: "I want MIT license for agent m; that should allow virtually any product
license." Every reader forks Agent M; without a licence, default copyright forbids exactly that reuse.
MIT puts no condition on the licence of the products built with it.
*Check:* `tests/test_licence.py` — the root `LICENSE` is the MIT text.
