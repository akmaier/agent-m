## 7. Configuration and secrets

**CONFIGURATION LIVES IN THE BROWSER** *(PO A. Maier, 2026-09-23)*
Endpoint, model and API key are stored in the browser of the person using the site; Agent M has no
other store for them.
*Occasion:* the Product Owner's requirement — no API key is exposed to the repository. With no
server (§0) the browser is the only place left, which makes the property structural rather than a
promise.
*Check:* `tests/test_config_client_side.py`

**CONFIGURATION IS STORED IN LOCALSTORAGE, NOT IN A COOKIE** *(PO A. Maier, 2026-09-23)*
Configuration is written to `localStorage`; Agent M sets no cookie carrying configuration or
credentials.
*Occasion:* a cookie set on the Pages origin is attached to every request to that origin and
therefore travels to GitHub's servers on each page load — the exposure the requirement exists to
prevent. `localStorage` is read only by script on the page and is never transmitted.
*Check:* `tests/test_no_config_cookie.py`

**A CREDENTIAL IS NEVER PLACED IN A URL** *(PO A. Maier, 2026-09-23)*
No key, token or credential appears in a query string, a fragment, or a link.
*Occasion:* URLs are logged by proxies, kept in browser history, and pasted into bug reports. A
credential that has been in a URL must be assumed to have leaked.
*Check:* `tests/test_no_credential_in_url.py`

**A TOKEN IS SCOPED TO WHAT IT WRITES** *(PO A. Maier, 2026-09-23)*
The GitHub token Agent M asks for carries write access only to the repositories of the products it
manages.
*Occasion:* each managed product is its own repository, so the page needs cross-repository access.
An account-wide token to edit one product's requirements is more authority than the task needs,
and the reader is the one who bears the consequence.
*Check:* `tests/test_token_scope_documented.py` — the configuration screen states the minimum
scope and why each part is needed.

**THE PAGE STATES WHAT IT SENDS WHERE** *(PO A. Maier, 2026-09-23)*
Before a run, Agent M names every destination it will contact and what it will send there.
*Occasion:* a reader is about to send their requirements — possibly their employer's requirements —
to a third-party model endpoint. That is a decision they should make knowingly, once, rather than
discover afterwards.
*Check:* `tests/test_destination_disclosure.py`

**A CLEAR IS A REAL CLEAR** *(PO A. Maier, 2026-09-23)*
Clearing the configuration removes the stored credentials from the browser, not only from the
displayed form.
*Occasion:* a reset that leaves the key in storage is worse than no reset, because the reader
believes the key is gone.
*Check:* `tests/test_clear_removes_storage.py`
