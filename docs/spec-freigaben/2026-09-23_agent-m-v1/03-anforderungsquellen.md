## 2. Requirement sources

**THE SOURCE MODEL IS GENERIC** *(PO A. Maier, 2026-09-23)*
A requirement source is a typed record with an identifier, a kind, and an authority; no particular
organisation, standard or system is built into Agent M.
*Occasion:* the Product Owner's instruction was explicit — organisations such as CBO or RRZE are
examples of a source, never the definition of one. A tool that knows about specific institutions
is useful to one reader and useless to the next.
*Check:* `tests/test_source_model.py` — no source identifier appears in Agent M's own code.

**A REQUIREMENT HAS A REGISTERED SOURCE** *(PO A. Maier, 2026-09-23)*
Every requirement names at least one registered source; a requirement without one cannot be
accepted.
*Occasion:* an unsourced requirement is indistinguishable from an invented one, and invented rules
are the expensive kind — the process repository states the general form as "nie raten": an honest
open question beats a confident wrong answer.
*Check:* `tests/test_requirement_has_source.py`

**A SOURCE DECLARES ITS AUTHORITY** *(SOFTWARE_MAINTENANCE.md / CLAUDE.md §1, adapted)*
A source declares whether it is `normative`, `advisory` or `informational`; the declaration is
made at the source, not inferred from how often it is cited.
*Occasion:* linking a document does not make it binding. Without the field, every source silently
becomes normative and a product acquires rules nobody agreed to.
*Check:* `tests/test_source_authority.py`

**A LIVING SOURCE IS PINNED** *(SOFTWARE_MAINTENANCE.md §11.1, adapted)*
A source that is maintained elsewhere records the exact state that was read — a commit, a version,
or a retrieval date — and a requirement derived from it names that state.
*Occasion:* a standard maintained in a git repository published three versions in eight days. A
dated copy in one's own tree looks like provenance and is in fact a snapshot that drifts; the
commit is the honest record.
*Check:* `tests/test_source_pinned.py`

**THE SOURCE KIND IS ONE OF A CLOSED SET** *(PO A. Maier, 2026-09-23)*
A source has exactly one kind from: `organisation`, `person`, `standard`, `regulation`,
`document`, `system`, `measurement`.
*Occasion:* a free-text kind cannot be reasoned about. The closed set is what lets the dashboard
answer "which requirements rest on a regulation?" — the question that matters when a regulation
changes.
*Check:* `tests/test_source_kind.py`
