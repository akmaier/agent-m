## 3. Requirements

**A REQUIREMENT HAS FIVE FIELDS** 
A requirement consists of a name, a source with a date, a rule, an occasion, and a check.
*Occasion:* the five fields are what make a requirement approvable. A paragraph in which rule,
reason and measurement run together cannot be decided on — not because it is long, but because one
cannot see what one is deciding.
*Check:* `tests/test_requirement_fields.py`

**ONE STATEMENT PER REQUIREMENT** 
The rule of a requirement is a single statement; a rule containing "and" or "additionally" is two
requirements.
*Occasion:* two rules in one entry cannot be approved, changed or withdrawn separately, so the
entry becomes a package deal forever.
*Check:* `tests/test_single_statement.py` — flags conjunctions in the rule field for review; the
decision stays human.

**A RULE IS CHECKABLE** 
A rule is stated so that it can be shown to hold or not hold.
*Occasion:* "Poppler wins on conflict" can be checked; "Docling is the expensive part" cannot — it
is a measurement, and it belongs in the occasion.
*Check:* no automatic check; at review.

**NO STATE IN THE SPECIFICATION** 
A requirement states the target, never the current condition of a system.
*Occasion:* "Poppler is not installed on the server" was true for exactly one day. Current
condition belongs in a check that establishes it, never in a document that asserts it.
*Check:* no automatic check; at review.

**A REQUIREMENT NAMES ITS CHECK** 
Every requirement names the test that guards it, or states explicitly that it is guarded only at
review.
*Occasion:* traceability is a field, not an assertion in code. A requirement with no named guard
is a wish, and a green test suite that does not know which requirements it protects proves
nothing about them.
*Check:* `tests/test_requirement_names_check.py`

**A REQUIREMENT IS NOT CHANGED WITHOUT AN IMPACT LIST** 
Before an existing requirement is changed, the artifacts that reference it are listed, and the
list is part of the proposal rather than a result reported afterwards.
*Occasion:* the renumbering that broke fifteen files would have produced the number "fifteen"
beforehand, had anyone looked. It was noticed afterwards.
*Check:* `tests/test_impact_list.py` — a change proposal touching an existing identifier carries
the derived reference list.
