## 1. Identity and traceability

**EVERY ARTIFACT HAS AN IDENTIFIER** *(PO A. Maier, 2026-09-23)*
Every artifact Agent M produces carries an identifier from the scheme `SRC-` · `REQ-` · `UC-` ·
`ARC-` · `MOD-` · `TST-`.
*Occasion:* an artifact that cannot be named cannot be referred to, and therefore cannot be traced
to what justified it or to what checks it.
*Check:* `tests/test_identifiers.py`

**THE NAME IS THE ID AND IT SURVIVES** *(SOFTWARE_MAINTENANCE.md, "Der Name ist die ID")*
An identifier travels with its artifact when the artifact moves between sections or files, and a
withdrawn identifier is never reused.
*Occasion:* a cosmetic renumbering in the process repository once broke references in fifteen
files without a single rule having changed. An address changes when things are rearranged; a name
does not.
*Check:* `tests/test_identifier_stability.py` — an identifier present in an earlier version and
absent now must carry a withdrawal note.

**EVERY ARTIFACT NAMES ITS ORIGIN** *(PO A. Maier, 2026-09-23)*
Each artifact names the identifiers of the artifacts it descends from: a requirement names its
source, a use case names the requirements it realises, a test names the requirement it guards.
*Occasion:* this is the V-model's horizontal arrow made mechanical. Without it, later evidence
floats free of the decisions it is supposed to support, and nobody can tell which requirement a
given test actually protects.
*Check:* `tests/test_origin_links.py`

**THE TRACEABILITY MATRIX IS DERIVED** *(PO A. Maier, 2026-09-23)*
The traceability matrix is computed from the artifacts and is never stored as a separately edited
document.
*Occasion:* a matrix maintained by hand is wrong most of the time and nobody notices, because the
document that would reveal the error is the document itself. A computed matrix is either correct
or visibly broken.
*Check:* `tests/test_matrix_derived.py`

**A REFERENCE NAMES THE IDENTIFIER, NOT THE POSITION** *(SOFTWARE_MAINTENANCE.md, same rule)*
A cross-reference names the identifier it points at, never a section number or line number.
*Occasion:* section numbers shift whenever a document is reorganised, and a reference that shifted
silently is worse than a missing one.
*Check:* `tests/test_references.py`
