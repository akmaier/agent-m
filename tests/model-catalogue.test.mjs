// The book's catalogue of process models (ITM-215) — MOD-model-catalogue's interface as the accepted text of
// docs/architecture/MOD-model-catalogue.md states it, for UC-002: Model, Catalogue, catalogue, modelSchema and modelFindings,
// and the shipped catalogue as data.
// Run: node --test tests/model-catalogue.test.mjs
//
// Module: MOD-model-catalogue
// Guards: UC-002; AGENT M CARRIES THE BOOK'S CATALOGUE; THE CATALOGUE IS DATA; THE MODEL DETERMINES THE PHASES AND THE GATES; A GATE NAMES WHAT IT CHECKS; A GATE NAMES WHO DECIDES IT; A PRACTICE IS NOT A MODEL; A MODEL DEFINITION IS VALIDATED BEFORE IT IS USED; A PROCESS MODEL ORGANISES PEOPLE AND AGENTS
// Level: unit
//
// What ITM-215 builds, and these tests state:
// - catalogue(instance) gives the shipped models — waterfall, V-model and reuse-oriented, whose work is planned (the
//   plan-driven group), Scrum and Kanban, whose work is pulled (the agile group) —, the instance's own models under
//   docs/process-models/, each model with its findings, and the shipped practices — DevOps, prototyping, incremental
//   delivery, the scaling layers — each with the models it fits. A shipped model's path is its path in the instance
//   repository, src/model-catalogue/models/<name>.md, and a model's version is the blob the instance's snapshot names for
//   its path. catalogue reads the instance's files through the snapshot, whose read returns a promise, so it returns one.
// - modelFindings(document) — for a document read with modelSchema.model — names, as an error on the line that causes it,
//   every rule the module file names: a transition naming a phase that is not defined, or a phase no transition reaches
//   from the first phase; a verification pair naming a missing phase; a gate without artifacts, without a condition or
//   without a decider; a role without capabilities, or a phase without a role; a phase producing a word that is no kind
//   of artifact, an explanation in parentheses after it dropped first; a gate that checks a kind of artifact no earlier
//   phase produces; pulled work with neither a time box nor a work-in-progress limit, or with both — a stated Time box of
//   none read as no time box —; a measure that does not fit the kind of work; no declaration of planned or pulled.
// - The module's code names no model and no practice: it finds the shipped ones as data, in the list of shipped files it
//   reads when it is loaded — from the disk in Node, from its own address in a browser (THE CATALOGUE IS DATA).
// - ITM-258: a kind in Produces may be followed by an explanation in parentheses — the kind is what stands before it,
//   Model.produces holds the kinds without their explanations, and a word before the parenthesis that is no kind is
//   still a finding —, and a Time box of none is no time box, flow.timeBox null; this repository's own
//   docs/process-models/scrum-wip.md, as it stands, has no error finding.
//
// Not tested here, since ITM-215 leaves them out: planGrid and modelDiagram. A model's `## About` and Model.about are
// ITM-229's, in tests/model-catalogue-about.test.mjs; here a Model without the section carries about null.
//
// Each test states its input and its expected result before it runs (given / input / expect). A test that expects no
// finding, or no name, first shows the same check finding one on a known positive. Nothing reaches the network. The
// counter-proofs are recorded in the pull request.
