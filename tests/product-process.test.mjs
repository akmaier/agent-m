// The declaration and the workflow of a product (ITM-218) — MOD-product-process' interface as the accepted text of
// docs/architecture/MOD-product-process.md states it, for UC-002: Workflow; declarationSchema, the schema of a product's
// docs/process.md, read from the module's own declaration.schema.md; declarationFindings; and workflowOf.
// Run: node --test tests/product-process.test.mjs
//
// Module: MOD-product-process
// Guards: UC-002; THE PROCESS MODEL IS DECLARED PER PRODUCT; A PROCESS MODEL ORGANISES PEOPLE AND AGENTS; THE MODEL DETERMINES THE PHASES AND THE GATES; A PROCESS REQUIREMENT ADDS TO THE MODEL; A PRACTICE IS NOT A MODEL; A ROLE NAMES THE CAPABILITIES IT NEEDS; A PRODUCT DECLARES ITS DEFINITION OF DONE; THE DEFAULT DEFINITION OF DONE IS THE JOB RULES; A PHASE OR A TIME BOX MAY HAVE A BRANCH OF ITS OWN; WORK MERGES INTO THE DEFAULT BRANCH UNLESS A BRANCH IS SET; A MODEL DEFINITION IS VALIDATED BEFORE IT IS USED
// Level: unit
//
// What ITM-218 builds, and these tests state:
// - declarationSchema reads a declaration: its front matter `model`, `model_file`, `model_version`, `sprint_close`; its
//   `## Roles` (Role, Participants), `## Practices`, `## Branches` (Phase or time box, Branch), `## Definition of Done`, and
//   the optional `## Gates added by requirements` (Requirement, Between, Artifacts, Condition, Decider). The module reads the
//   schema from its own declaration.schema.md once, when it is loaded: from the disk in Node, from its own address in a
//   browser.
// - declarationFindings(declaration, catalogue, participants, sources, instanceSpec) names, each as an error, against the
//   Catalogue at the commit the declaration's model_version names: a model that catalogue does not hold at model_file, or
//   whose findings in it hold an error; a role that needs a person and has none; a practice the catalogue does not hold, or
//   whose `fits` does not name the model; a branch for a phase the model lacks; a gate under `## Gates added by
//   requirements` whose requirement the instance's SPEC does not hold.
// - workflowOf(declaration, model, practices, instanceSpec) gives the model's phases, transitions, verification pairs and
//   gates and the gates the process requirements add, each with its requirement and the source that requirement names in
//   the instance's SPEC, and nothing else; the roles with their holders, the branches, and the job rules as the Definition
//   of Done, with the conditions the declaration adds after them.
//
// Not tested here, since ITM-218 leaves them out: holdsRole, gateSchema, gateStates, mayDecide, recordGateDecision,
// doneCheck and processStrategies; a holder lacking a capability its role needs, and the warning about a holder at a place a
// linked source does not permit — both go through MOD-participant-list's eligible —; and a practice's additions, which
// workflowOf does not add (a shipped practice states its `## Adds` in words only).
//
// The fixture product declares an instance model, docs/process-models/team-scrum.md — Scrum adapted so that its Product
// Owner must be a person —, at the commit VERSION. Its Catalogue is the one MOD-model-catalogue's catalogue gives over the
// instance's snapshot at that commit; its participants are the fixture register read with MOD-participant-list's schema; the
// instance's SPEC is a fixture text. Agent M's own docs/process.md is read as it stands and never changed; no test opens
// Agent M's SPEC.md.
//
// Each test states its input and its expected result before it runs (given / input / expect). A test that expects no
// finding has its known positives in the tests after it, each of which changes one line of the fixture and finds one. Nothing
// reaches the network. The counter-proofs are recorded in the pull request.
