// states it, for UC-002: sourceSchemas, which gives the schema of a register entry, and permittedPlaces, the processing
// places to which the content of a source may be given. The schema of a product's links file, sourceSchemas' `links`, is not

// Guards: UC-002; RESTRICTED CONTENT GOES ONLY WHERE ITS SOURCE PERMITS; A SOURCE DECLARES ITS LICENCE; THE SOURCE KIND IS ONE OF A CLOSED SET; A SOURCE DECLARES ITS AUTHORITY; A STANDARD IS REGISTERED BY ITS DESIGNATION; A SOURCE VERSION IS NEVER OVERWRITTEN
// Level: unit
//
// Every expected value is read from the module file. Its Data: a register entry `docs/sources/SRC-<slug>.md` with the front
// matter keys id, title, kind (one of seven), authority (one of three), licence (`may be republished`, `restricted`, or
// `unknown`, which counts as restricted, and the licence's name or terms), designation (for a standard), identifier,
// content_repository and places; its body `## Versions`, a table with one row per version, appended and never changed, and
// optionally `## Parts`. Its Interfaces: `permittedPlaces(entry: Document) -> string[] | "any"` — any for content that may be
// republished, its declared places otherwise, none when it declares none.
//
// The entries are read as every caller reads them: through MOD-documents' interface, with the schema sourceSchemas gives,
// whose file has the form ITM-213 settled (one ```json block in a *.schema.md file; a section named by its heading line, of
// which the first table is read). Where the module file names no column of `## Versions`, the columns are those of this
// instance's own entry, docs/sources/SRC-vibe-coding.md: Version, Date, Edition, Read from, Files. That entry is read as it
// stands and never changed.
//
// Each test states its input and its expected result before it runs (given / input / expect); where a test asserts that
// something is refused, the same call is first shown to succeed on a known positive. Nothing reaches the network. The
