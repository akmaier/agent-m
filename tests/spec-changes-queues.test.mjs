// Queues — MOD-spec-changes' Queue and queues, as the accepted text of docs/architecture/MOD-spec-changes.md states
// them: every queue of a snapshot with its entries, read from each queue's index.md and entscheidungen.md and from
// the approval records under docs/approvals/ — matched to an entry by name alone, as MOD-approvals' statuses matches
// a reviewed file (no record's text is read). Each entry in the state open, approved or in SPEC. The states stale and
// waiting for its anchor are not part of this item: they need a SPEC section's text; such an entry reads as open.
// Nothing else of the module is part of this item (ITM-234, Outcome).
// Run: node --test tests/spec-changes-queues.test.mjs
//
// Module: MOD-spec-changes
// Guards: UC-047; STATUS IS DERIVED FROM THE RECORDS

// Each test states its input and its expected result before it runs (given / input / expect). queues is given a
// snapshot already held in memory (paths, blob SHAs and a read of the files it has not read yet, as MOD-repository-
// hosts' Snapshot gives them); the fixtures below are plain objects of that shape — no readSnapshot, no fetch.
// Nothing sleeps or waits. The counter-proofs are recorded in the pull request.
