// The release tests of UC-047, Be told what waits for your acceptance (ITM-238): one or more for every requirement UC-047
// realises, through the settings page and the main and review pages as the dashboard reaches MOD-notifications since the
// change between jobs #157 — reached the way tests/dashboard-notifications-wiring.test.mjs reaches them: tests/app-
// harness.mjs's repoServer and openDashboard, a browser's Notification/navigator/setInterval stood in for the way that
// file's own installBrowser() does, never a real timer. Every expected result is the requirement's own; where the page
// disagrees, the test follows the requirement and is marked todo with its FINDING (docs/instructions/developers.md, "An
// item of release or system tests").
//
// Written by developer-sonnet-e, the release tester, who implemented none of it.
//
// Run: node --test tests/release-sprint-07-uc-047-notifications.test.mjs
//
// Module: MOD-notifications
// Guards: A PERSON IS TOLD WHAT WAITS FOR THEIR ACCEPTANCE; NOTIFICATIONS ARE SWITCHED ON BY THE PERSON; STATUS IS DERIVED FROM THE RECORDS; PROGRESS AND JOB STATE ARE DERIVED, NOT STORED; CONFIGURATION LIVES IN THE BROWSER; EVERY SETTING IS REACHED FROM ONE PAGE; A BROWSER SETTING IS TESTED AND CLEARED WHERE IT IS SHOWN; A TOKEN GOES ONLY TO THE SERVER THAT ISSUED IT; EVERY STEP EXPLAINS ITSELF; NO SERVER
