# Agent M — Specification

**VERBINDLICH (SPEC)**

This is the single binding document of Agent M. A sentence belongs here when its violation would
be a defect. Everything else — how something is built, what was measured, what is planned —
belongs in `PLAN.md`, in `docs/measurements/`, or in the code, and does not bind.

**No section of this file is written by hand.** Each one is proposed in
`docs/spec-freigaben/<date>_<name>/`, shown next to the text it would replace, and written only
when the Product Owner accepts it there (`scripts/spec_dashboard.py` in the process repository).
That is why the sections below are still empty: the skeleton fixes the anchors, the approval
fixes the content.

**Form of a requirement** (from `SOFTWARE_MAINTENANCE.md`, *"Wie eine Anforderung aussieht"*):
a **name** in capitals that is the ID and never changes, a **source with a date**, one **rule**
stated as a single testable sentence, an **occasion** of one or two lines, and the **check** that
guards it. One statement per requirement — an "and" in the rule means it is two.

---

## 0. Hard product rules

These four hold for every version of Agent M. A change to any of them is a change to what the
product is.

**NO SERVER** *(PO A. Maier, 2026-09-23)*
Agent M is delivered as a static site, repository conventions, and optional workflows; the project
operates no server, no account system and no database.
*Occasion:* a book companion that requires an account is a service, and a service that outlives
the reader's interest in it is a liability. GitHub Pages plus the reader's own repository has no
such tail.
*Check:* `tests/test_no_backend.py` — the built site contains no call to an origin other than the
configured endpoint, the GitHub API, the GitLab servers of the listed products, and the local bridge.

**ARTIFACTS ARE MARKDOWN** *(Vibe Coding, ch. 9 §6)*
Every artifact Agent M produces is Markdown, with diagrams written as Mermaid inside it.
*Occasion:* text-first artifacts can be versioned, diffed in a pull request, and read by both a
person and a model. Binary diagram formats break all three at once.
*Check:* `tests/test_artifact_format.py`

**NO SECRET IN THE REPOSITORY** *(PO A. Maier, 2026-09-23)*
No API key, access token or endpoint credential is written into a repository managed by Agent M.
*Occasion:* the reader's key is their own. A tool that can leak it into a public repository has
one failure mode too many, and the failure is not recoverable by deleting the commit.
*Check:* `tests/test_no_secret_written.py` — a generated artifact containing a configured secret
value fails the run.

**THE PRODUCT REPOSITORY IS SELF-SUFFICIENT** *(PO A. Maier, 2026-09-23)*
Removing Agent M leaves a complete, readable set of artifacts behind in the product repository.
*Occasion:* lock-in is the usual price of a workflow tool. Here it can be avoided for free,
because the artifacts were going to be Markdown anyway — so it is stated as a rule rather than
left to good intentions.
*Check:* `tests/test_self_sufficient.py` — no artifact references a file or service that exists
only inside Agent M.
## 1. Identity and traceability

**EVERY ARTIFACT HAS AN IDENTIFIER** *(PO A. Maier, 2026-09-23)*
Every artifact Agent M produces carries an identifier from the scheme `SRC-` · `REQ-` · `UC-` ·
`ARC-` · `MOD-` · `TST-`.
*Occasion:* an artifact that cannot be named cannot be referred to, and therefore cannot be traced
to what justified it or to what checks it.
*Check:* `tests/test_identifiers.py`

**THE NAME IS THE ID AND IT SURVIVES** *(SOFTWARE_MAINTENANCE.md, "Der Name ist die ID")*
An identifier travels with its artifact when the artifact moves between sections or files, and a
withdrawn identifier is never reused.
*Occasion:* a cosmetic renumbering in the process repository once broke references in fifteen
files without a single rule having changed. An address changes when things are rearranged; a name
does not.
*Check:* `tests/test_identifier_stability.py` — an identifier present in an earlier version and
absent now must carry a withdrawal note.

**EVERY ARTIFACT NAMES ITS ORIGIN** *(PO A. Maier, 2026-09-23)*
Each artifact names the identifiers of the artifacts it descends from: a requirement names its
source, a use case names the requirements it realises, a test names the requirement it guards.
*Occasion:* this is the V-model's horizontal arrow made mechanical. Without it, later evidence
floats free of the decisions it is supposed to support, and nobody can tell which requirement a
given test actually protects.
*Check:* `tests/test_origin_links.py`

**THE TRACEABILITY MATRIX IS DERIVED** *(PO A. Maier, 2026-09-23)*
The traceability matrix is computed from the artifacts and is never stored as a separately edited
document.
*Occasion:* a matrix maintained by hand is wrong most of the time and nobody notices, because the
document that would reveal the error is the document itself. A computed matrix is either correct
or visibly broken.
*Check:* `tests/test_matrix_derived.py`

**A REFERENCE NAMES THE IDENTIFIER, NOT THE POSITION** *(SOFTWARE_MAINTENANCE.md, same rule)*
A cross-reference names the identifier it points at, never a section number or line number.
*Occasion:* section numbers shift whenever a document is reorganised, and a reference that shifted
silently is worse than a missing one.
*Check:* `tests/test_references.py`
## 2. Requirement sources

**THE SOURCE MODEL IS GENERIC** *(PO A. Maier, 2026-09-23)*
A requirement source is a typed record with an identifier, a kind, and an authority; no particular
organisation, standard or system is built into Agent M.
*Occasion:* the Product Owner's instruction was explicit — organisations such as CBO or RRZE are
examples of a source, never the definition of one. A tool that knows about specific institutions
is useful to one reader and useless to the next.
*Check:* `tests/test_source_model.py` — no source identifier appears in Agent M's own code.

**A REQUIREMENT HAS A REGISTERED SOURCE** *(PO A. Maier, 2026-09-23)*
Every requirement names at least one registered source; a requirement without one cannot be
accepted.
*Occasion:* an unsourced requirement is indistinguishable from an invented one, and invented rules
are the expensive kind — the process repository states the general form as "nie raten": an honest
open question beats a confident wrong answer.
*Check:* `tests/test_requirement_has_source.py`

**A SOURCE DECLARES ITS AUTHORITY** *(PO A. Maier, 2026-09-23)*
A source declares whether it is `normative`, `advisory` or `informational`; the declaration is
made at the source, not inferred from how often it is cited.
*Occasion:* linking a document does not make it binding. Without the field, every source silently
becomes normative and a product acquires rules nobody agreed to.
*Check:* `tests/test_source_authority.py`

**A LIVING SOURCE IS PINNED** *(PO A. Maier, 2026-09-23)*
A source that is maintained elsewhere records the exact state that was read — a commit, a version,
or a retrieval date — and a requirement derived from it names that state.
*Occasion:* a standard maintained in a git repository published three versions in eight days. A
dated copy in one's own tree looks like provenance and is in fact a snapshot that drifts; the
commit is the honest record.
*Check:* `tests/test_source_pinned.py`

**THE SOURCE KIND IS ONE OF A CLOSED SET** *(PO A. Maier, 2026-09-23)*
A source has exactly one kind from: `organisation`, `person`, `standard`, `regulation`,
`document`, `system`, `measurement`.
*Occasion:* a free-text kind cannot be reasoned about. The closed set is what lets the dashboard
answer "which requirements rest on a regulation?" — the question that matters when a regulation
changes.
*Check:* `tests/test_source_kind.py`
## 3. Requirements

**A REQUIREMENT HAS FIVE FIELDS** *(PO A. Maier, 2026-09-23)*
A requirement consists of a name, a source with a date, a rule, an occasion, and a check.
*Occasion:* the five fields are what make a requirement approvable. A paragraph in which rule,
reason and measurement run together cannot be decided on — not because it is long, but because one
cannot see what one is deciding.
*Check:* `tests/test_requirement_fields.py`

**ONE STATEMENT PER REQUIREMENT** *(PO A. Maier, 2026-09-23)*
The rule of a requirement is a single statement; a rule containing "and" or "additionally" is two
requirements.
*Occasion:* two rules in one entry cannot be approved, changed or withdrawn separately, so the
entry becomes a package deal forever.
*Check:* `tests/test_single_statement.py` — flags conjunctions in the rule field for review; the
decision stays human.

**A RULE IS CHECKABLE** *(PO A. Maier, 2026-09-23)*
A rule is stated so that it can be shown to hold or not hold.
*Occasion:* "Poppler wins on conflict" can be checked; "Docling is the expensive part" cannot — it
is a measurement, and it belongs in the occasion.
*Check:* no automatic check; at review.

**NO STATE IN THE SPECIFICATION** *(PO A. Maier, 2026-09-23)*
A requirement states the target, never the current condition of a system.
*Occasion:* "Poppler is not installed on the server" was true for exactly one day. Current
condition belongs in a check that establishes it, never in a document that asserts it.
*Check:* no automatic check; at review.

**A REQUIREMENT NAMES ITS CHECK** *(PO A. Maier, 2026-09-23)*
Every requirement names the test that guards it, or states explicitly that it is guarded only at
review.
*Occasion:* traceability is a field, not an assertion in code. A requirement with no named guard
is a wish, and a green test suite that does not know which requirements it protects proves
nothing about them.
*Check:* `tests/test_requirement_names_check.py`

**A REQUIREMENT IS NOT CHANGED WITHOUT AN IMPACT LIST** *(PO A. Maier, 2026-09-23)*
Before an existing requirement is changed, the artifacts that reference it are listed, and the
list is part of the proposal rather than a result reported afterwards.
*Occasion:* the renumbering that broke fifteen files would have produced the number "fifteen"
beforehand, had anyone looked. It was noticed afterwards.
*Check:* `tests/test_impact_list.py` — a change proposal touching an existing identifier carries
the derived reference list.
## 4. Use cases and models

**A USE CASE REALISES NAMED REQUIREMENTS** *(PO A. Maier, 2026-09-23)*
Every use case names the requirement identifiers it realises.
*Occasion:* a use case that realises nothing is either a missing requirement or a feature nobody
asked for, and the difference matters. Naming the requirements makes the question answerable
instead of arguable.
*Check:* `tests/test_usecase_realises.py`

**A USE CASE HAS ACTOR, PRECONDITION, FLOW AND POSTCONDITION** *(Vibe Coding, ch. 9 §2.1)*
A use-case description names its actor, its precondition, its main flow, its alternative flows,
and its postcondition.
*Occasion:* a use case captures a goal before it captures an implementation. Without the
precondition and postcondition it degrades into a feature list with actors attached.
*Check:* `tests/test_usecase_fields.py`

**DIAGRAMS ARE MERMAID IN MARKDOWN** *(Vibe Coding, ch. 9 §6)*
Every diagram is written as Mermaid inside the Markdown document it belongs to; no diagram is
stored as an image file.
*Occasion:* a diagram that is code can be versioned, diffed in a pull request, and read by a model
without visual parsing. An exported image can do none of these and drifts from the document it
illustrates.
*Check:* `tests/test_diagrams_are_mermaid.py`

**THE PROSE IS AUTHORITATIVE, THE DIAGRAM IS THE OVERVIEW** *(PO A. Maier, 2026-09-23)*
Where a diagram and its use-case description disagree, the description holds.
*Occasion:* Mermaid has no UML use-case diagram; the actor-and-ellipse notation is approximated
with a flowchart, as the reference project `akmaier/dvd_database` does. An approximation must not
be allowed to become the source of truth by accident.
*Check:* no automatic check; at review.

**UNREALISED REQUIREMENTS ARE REPORTED, NOT FORBIDDEN** *(PO A. Maier, 2026-09-23)*
A requirement with no use case and a use case with no requirement are both shown in the dashboard;
neither blocks a run.
*Occasion:* early in a product, unrealised requirements are the normal state. A gate that blocks
on them would train everyone to switch the gate off — the failure mode the process repository
records as a check that is red so often it stops being read.
*Check:* `tests/test_coverage_report.py`
## 5. Process models and profiles

**THE PROCESS MODEL IS DECLARED PER PRODUCT** *(PO A. Maier, 2026-09-23)*
Each managed product declares exactly one process model; Agent M does not assume a default.
*Occasion:* choosing a process is risk balancing, not a methodology contest — each model manages
one risk well and accepts another. A tool that silently assumes one has made the choice for the
reader and hidden the trade-off.
*Check:* `tests/test_model_declared.py`

**THE CATALOGUE IS DATA** *(PO A. Maier, 2026-09-23)*
Process models are declarative definitions in data files, not code paths; adding a model requires
no change to Agent M's implementation.
*Occasion:* the catalogue will grow — the book alone names nine, and readers will bring their own.
A model encoded as branching logic makes the tenth model a refactor.
*Check:* `tests/test_catalogue_is_data.py` — no model name appears in Agent M's implementation.

**THE MODEL DETERMINES THE STAGES AND THE GATES** *(Vibe Coding, ch. 6–7)*
A model definition names its stages, their order, which stages pair for verification, and where
the gates sit; Agent M derives the workflow from that definition alone.
*Occasion:* this is the difference between offering process models and merely naming them. The
V-model's contribution is precisely that a decomposition step is paired with the check that will
verify it; if the pairing is not in the data, the model is decoration.
*Check:* `tests/test_workflow_from_model.py`

**AGENT M CARRIES THE BOOK'S CATALOGUE** *(Vibe Coding, ch. 6–7)*
The shipped catalogue contains waterfall, V-model, reuse-oriented, incremental/prototyping, agile,
Kanban, Scrum, DevOps, and disciplined agile delivery at scale.
*Occasion:* Agent M is the book's companion. A reader who has just read chapter 6 must find the
models of chapter 6.
*Check:* `tests/test_catalogue_complete.py`

**A PROFILE ADDS, IT DOES NOT REPLACE** *(Vibe Coding, ch. 6, regulated-software section)*
A profile — for example IEC 62304 safety class A, B or C — adds required artifacts and evidence to
whatever model is underneath; it never substitutes for the model.
*Occasion:* a regulated project does not stop being agile, it acquires obligations. Modelling
regulation as a separate process model would force the reader to abandon the working rhythm in
order to satisfy an auditor.
*Check:* `tests/test_profile_is_additive.py`

**A GATE NAMES WHAT IT CHECKS** *(PO A. Maier, 2026-09-23)*
Every gate in a model definition names the artifacts that must exist and the condition that must
hold before the next stage opens.
*Occasion:* an unnamed gate is a pause, not a check. The point of a phase gate is that somebody
can say afterwards what was verified at it.
*Check:* `tests/test_gate_definition.py`
## 6. Runtimes

**ONE DEFINITION, THREE DRIVERS** *(PO A. Maier, 2026-09-23)*
The prompts, schemas and stage definitions exist exactly once, as data in the repository; the
browser, the GitHub Actions workflow and the local bridge are drivers over that one definition.
*Occasion:* three independently maintained copies of one rule were the root cause of an entire
measurement complex in the process repository — each copy knew phrases the others lacked, and
nobody could say which was right. Three runtimes make that failure three times as likely.
*Check:* `tests/test_single_definition.py` — no prompt or schema text appears in more than one
place.

**A RUNTIME IS INTERCHANGEABLE** *(PO A. Maier, 2026-09-23)*
The same stage, given the same inputs, produces the same kind of artifact in all three runtimes.
*Occasion:* if runtimes differ in what they produce, the choice of runtime becomes a hidden
product decision and a reader cannot move between them.
*Check:* `tests/test_runtime_parity.py`

**THE LOCAL BRIDGE BINDS TO LOOPBACK ONLY** *(PO A. Maier, 2026-09-23)*
The local bridge accepts a bind address of `127.0.0.1`, `::1` or `localhost` and refuses any other.
*Occasion:* the bridge hands work to a CLI session that is already authenticated on the machine.
Its protection is the loopback bind; a tool that can be started on a LAN address has none.
*Check:* `tests/test_bridge_loopback.py`

**REMOTE ACCESS TO THE BRIDGE GOES THROUGH A TUNNEL** *(PO A. Maier, 2026-09-23)*
Remote work reaches the local bridge only through an authenticated tunnel or port forward, such as
SSH, that ends on the bridge's loopback address.
*Occasion:* working from another machine is a legitimate need. A tunnel meets it without widening
the bind: the bridge stays invisible on the network, and the tunnel brings its own authentication.
*Check:* `tests/test_bridge_tunnel.py` — the bridge answers through a forwarded loopback port and
on no non-loopback interface.

**THE LOCAL BRIDGE REQUIRES A TOKEN** *(PO A. Maier, 2026-09-23)*
The bridge rejects any request that does not carry the session token it printed at startup.
*Occasion:* loopback is not a permission boundary between programs on the same machine. Any local
process, including a page from an unrelated site, can reach a loopback port.
*Check:* `tests/test_bridge_token.py`

**AN UNSUPPORTED ENDPOINT SAYS SO** *(PO A. Maier, 2026-09-23)*
When a configured endpoint cannot be called from the browser, Agent M names the reason and the
runtimes that would work instead; it does not report a generic failure.
*Occasion:* browser access to model endpoints is not uniform — some providers reject cross-origin
calls outright, others require an explicit opt-in header, and self-hosted gateways depend on local
configuration. A reader facing an opaque error will conclude the tool is broken.
*Check:* `tests/test_endpoint_diagnosis.py`

**BROWSER REACHABILITY IS MEASURED, NOT ASSUMED** *(PO A. Maier, 2026-09-23)*
Before a runtime is released, the browser behaviour it depends on is measured on current browsers
and the result is recorded in `docs/measurements/`.
*Occasion:* the two mechanisms this design rests on — cross-origin calls to model endpoints, and
Private Network Access preflights or SSH for the local bridge — are documented and neither is
verified here. A design built on an unverified mechanism fails late and expensively.
*Check:* `tests/test_measurement_present.py` — a released runtime has a dated measurement file.
## 7. Configuration and secrets

**CONFIGURATION LIVES IN THE BROWSER** *(PO A. Maier, 2026-09-23)*
Endpoint, model, model API key and GitHub token are stored in the browser of the person using the
site; Agent M has no other store for them.
*Occasion:* the Product Owner's requirement — no API key is exposed to the repository. With no
server (§0) the browser is the only place left, which makes the property structural rather than a
promise.
*Check:* `tests/test_config_client_side.py`

**CONFIGURATION IS STORED IN LOCALSTORAGE, NOT IN A COOKIE** *(PO A. Maier, 2026-09-23)*
Configuration is written to `localStorage`; Agent M sets no cookie carrying configuration or
credentials.
*Occasion:* a cookie set on the Pages origin is attached to every request to that origin and
therefore travels to GitHub's servers on each page load — the exposure the requirement exists to
prevent. `localStorage` is read only by script on the page and is never transmitted.
*Check:* `tests/test_no_config_cookie.py`

**A CREDENTIAL IS NEVER PLACED IN A URL** *(PO A. Maier, 2026-09-23)*
No key, token or credential appears in a query string, a fragment, or a link.
*Occasion:* URLs are logged by proxies, kept in browser history, and pasted into bug reports. A
credential that has been in a URL must be assumed to have leaked.
*Check:* `tests/test_no_credential_in_url.py`

**A TOKEN IS SCOPED TO WHAT IT WRITES** *(PO A. Maier, 2026-09-23)*
The GitHub token Agent M asks for carries write access only to the repositories of the products it
manages.
*Occasion:* each managed product is its own repository, so the page needs cross-repository access.
An account-wide token to edit one product's requirements is more authority than the task needs,
and the reader is the one who bears the consequence.
*Check:* `tests/test_token_scope_documented.py` — the configuration screen states the minimum
scope and why each part is needed.

**THE PAGE STATES WHAT IT SENDS WHERE** *(PO A. Maier, 2026-09-23)*
Before a run, Agent M names every destination it will contact and what it will send there.
*Occasion:* a reader is about to send their requirements — possibly their employer's requirements —
to a third-party model endpoint. That is a decision they should make knowingly, once, rather than
discover afterwards.
*Check:* `tests/test_destination_disclosure.py`

**A CLEAR IS A REAL CLEAR** *(PO A. Maier, 2026-09-23)*
Clearing the configuration removes the stored credentials from the browser, not only from the
displayed form.
*Occasion:* a reset that leaves the key in storage is worse than no reset, because the reader
believes the key is gone.
*Check:* `tests/test_clear_removes_storage.py`

**THE GITHUB TOKEN IS PASTED, NOT OBTAINED BY LOGIN** *(PO A. Maier, 2026-09-23)*
Agent M uses a fine-grained personal access token that the person creates on github.com and pastes
into Agent M's settings.
*Occasion:* a "Sign in with GitHub" flow exchanges a code for a token, and that exchange needs a
server (§0 `NO SERVER`). A pasted token needs none, and the person decides its scope and expiry on
GitHub's own page.
*Check:* no automatic check; at review.

**THE TOKEN IS SENT ONLY TO GITHUB** *(PO A. Maier, 2026-09-23)*
The GitHub token leaves the browser only as the authorisation header of requests to GitHub's API
and to GitHub's raw file host.
*Occasion:* a credential that can reach a third origin can leak there; the model endpoint in
particular never needs it.
*Check:* `tests/review-core.test.mjs`

**THE SHARED PAGES ORIGIN IS DISCLOSED** *(PO A. Maier, 2026-09-23)*
The settings page states, before a token or key is stored, that every GitHub Pages site under the
same `<owner>.github.io` domain can read what Agent M stores in the browser.
*Occasion:* browser storage belongs to the origin, not to the path. Measured 2026-09-23: seven Pages
sites share `https://akmaier.github.io`, and each could read Agent M's storage. The person decides
whether that is acceptable, or hosts their instance under an owner used for nothing else.
*Check:* `tests/test_settings_disclosure.py`

**THE TOKEN LINK IS PREFILLED** *(PO A. Maier, 2026-09-24)*
Agent M links to GitHub's page for new fine-grained tokens with name, description, expiry and the
required permissions already filled in.
*Occasion:* people new to GitHub should not have to find the page or know what a permission is.
Measured 2026-09-24: GitHub prefills `name`, `description`, `expires_in` and permissions such as
`contents` from the link.
*Check:* `tests/test_token_scope_documented.py`

**THE REPOSITORY CHOICE IS SPELLED OUT** *(PO A. Maier, 2026-09-24)*
Agent M tells the person to choose *Only select repositories* on GitHub's token page and names each
repository to select.
*Occasion:* the link cannot preselect repositories — GitHub documents no parameter for it — and
with prefilled permissions the page defaults to *All repositories* (measured 2026-09-24), the
broadest choice and the one `A TOKEN IS SCOPED TO WHAT IT WRITES` rules out.
*Check:* `tests/test_token_scope_documented.py`
## 8. Versioning

**CALENDAR VERSIONS** *(PO A. Maier, 2026-09-23)*
Agent M and every product built with it use calendar versioning in the form `YYYY.MINOR.PATCH`.
*Occasion:* the Product Owner's instruction, and the scheme already in use across the taskforce's
products. A year in the version number tells a reader how old a release is without a changelog.
*Check:* `tests/test_version_format.py`

**EVERY PRODUCT HAS ITS OWN VERSION LINE** *(PO A. Maier, 2026-09-23)*
One Agent M instance manages several products in parallel; each product's version is independent
of Agent M's and of every other product's.
*Occasion:* a shared version line would couple unrelated products, so that one product's release
would renumber the others.
*Check:* `tests/test_version_independence.py`

**A RELEASE IS TAGGED AND LOGGED** *(PO A. Maier, 2026-09-23)*
A release raises the version, adds a dated entry to the changelog, and sets the git tag
`vYYYY.MINOR.PATCH`.
*Occasion:* a version number that exists only in a file cannot be checked out. The tag is what
makes a stated version recoverable.
*Check:* `tests/test_release_artifacts.py`

**AN ARTIFACT RECORDS THE VERSION THAT PRODUCED IT** *(PO A. Maier, 2026-09-23)*
Every generated artifact records the Agent M version, the model, and the date of its generation.
*Occasion:* when output quality changes, the first question is what changed — the prompt, the
model, or the source. Without the record, none of the three can be ruled out.
*Check:* `tests/test_artifact_provenance.py`

**A VERSION IS NOT REWRITTEN** *(PO A. Maier, 2026-09-23)*
A released version is never re-tagged or overwritten; a correction is a new version.
*Occasion:* a tag that moves makes every reference to it a statement about an unknown state, and
the dashboard's comparison across versions becomes meaningless.
*Check:* `tests/test_tags_immutable.py`
## 9. Human gates

**A GENERATED ARTIFACT IS A PROPOSAL** *(PO A. Maier, 2026-09-23, reworded 2026-09-23)*
Everything Agent M generates counts as a proposal until a person accepts it.
*Occasion:* generation is cheap and review is not, so the volume of candidate changes grows faster
than the capacity to check them. What decides is not where a text is stored but whether a person
has accepted it.
*Check:* `tests/review-core.test.mjs` — a file without an approval record naming its current text
is shown as open.

**A REVIEWED ARTIFACT ENTERS THE DEFAULT BRANCH AS OPEN** *(PO A. Maier, 2026-09-23)*
A use case or a SPEC change proposal may be written directly to the default branch, where it counts
as open until an approval record names its text.
*Occasion:* for these artifacts the approval record is the gate. A pull request in front of it
added a second click that controlled nothing: a merged use case was still open, and an unmerged one
could not be reviewed on the dashboard at all.
*Check:* `tests/review-core.test.mjs`

**CODE ENTERS THE DEFAULT BRANCH THROUGH A PULL REQUEST WITH GREEN CI** *(PO A. Maier, 2026-09-23)*
A change to code, tests, workflows or the dashboard reaches the default branch only through a pull
request whose CI run is green.
*Occasion:* code has no approval record; the pull request with its CI run is its only check. Who
merges once CI is green is not restricted — the author of the change may merge it, including an
agent.
*Check:* no automatic check; at review. The repository's branch protection can enforce it.

**A SPECIFICATION CHANGE IS APPROVED BEFORE IT IS WRITTEN** *(PO A. Maier, 2026-09-23; after "JEDE
SPEC-AENDERUNG LAEUFT UEBER DAS FREIGABE-WERKZEUG")*
A change to a product's specification is shown beside the text it would replace and is written
only after a person accepts it.
*Occasion:* a specification written first and approved afterwards was never approved. In one night
in the source process, twenty-one changes across roughly two thousand lines entered a
specification without agreement, because proposals made in conversation lose the current text they
are replacing.
*Check:* `tests/test_spec_gate.py`

**THE APPROVED TEXT IS TAKEN VERBATIM** *(PO A. Maier, 2026-09-23; after "DER PO-TEXT WIRD WORTGETREU
UEBERNOMMEN")*
What stands in the approval field is exactly what is written to the specification; nothing
reformulates it afterwards.
*Occasion:* verbatim transfer is the property that makes an approval an approval.
*Check:* `tests/test_verbatim.py`

**NO PROPOSAL WITHOUT THE CURRENT TEXT BESIDE IT** *(PO A. Maier, 2026-09-23; after "KEIN VORSCHLAG OHNE
DEN IST-ZUSTAND DANEBEN")*
A change is presented together with the specification text that currently holds, not as a summary
of it.
*Occasion:* one cannot decide about a text one cannot see.
*Check:* `tests/test_proposal_shows_current.py`

**EVOLUTION ENTERS THROUGH THE SPECIFICATION** *(PO A. Maier, 2026-09-23)*
A GitHub issue that changes behaviour becomes a specification change first and a code change
second.
*Occasion:* this is the whole argument of the book's evolution chapter made mechanical. A code
change that precedes its requirement leaves the specification describing a product that no longer
exists, and the next reader believes the specification.
*Check:* `tests/test_issue_to_spec.py`

**THE GATE IS RECORDED** *(PO A. Maier, 2026-09-23)*
Every passed gate records who decided, when, and on which text.
*Occasion:* an unrecorded approval is indistinguishable from no approval three months later, and
it is precisely the evidence a regulated profile (§5) has to produce.
*Check:* `tests/test_gate_record.py`

**THE REPLACED TEXT STAYS REACHABLE** *(PO A. Maier, 2026-09-23; after "DER ERSETZTE TEXT BLEIBT
AUFFINDBAR")*
A replaced specification section remains reachable through the git history; no second copy is kept
in the working tree.
*Occasion:* a shortening is safe only if the removed part can still be moved where it belongs. A
duplicate folder did that a second time and drifted away from the history.
*Check:* `tests/test_replaced_in_history.py`

**A PERSON'S OWN INPUT IS COMMITTED DIRECTLY** *(PO A. Maier, 2026-09-24)*
What a person enters in Agent M themselves — a requirement source, a product, a release — is
committed to the default branch under their own account when they save it.
*Occasion:* the person who typed it has already decided on it; a second review of one's own input
adds a click and no control.
*Check:* `tests/review-core.test.mjs`

**ADDING A PRODUCT CREATES ITS LAYOUT** *(PO A. Maier, 2026-09-24)*
When a person adds a product, Agent M writes the missing review layout into the product's default
branch and the product's entry into the instance's `docs/products.md`, without a pull request.
*Occasion:* PO, 2026-09-24: two merges in one setup "is a bit much. Both need to be automated."
The layout is empty folders and a SPEC skeleton; there is nothing in it to review.
*Check:* `tests/review-core.test.mjs`
## 10. Review on GitHub Pages

**THE PAGES ROOT IS DOCS** *(PO A. Maier, 2026-09-23, products removed 2026-09-23)*
The GitHub Pages site of an Agent M instance is served from the `docs/` folder of its default
branch.
*Occasion:* one known place for everything a reviewer reads. Code, tooling and the SPEC's approval
machinery stay outside the published tree.
*Check:* `tests/test_pages_layout.py`

**ONE REVIEW LAYOUT FOR EVERY PRODUCT** *(PO A. Maier, 2026-09-23)*
Agent M and every managed product use the same layout below `docs/`: use cases in
`docs/use-cases/`, SPEC change queues in `docs/spec-freigaben/`, approval records in
`docs/approvals/`.
*Occasion:* products will adopt this structure later. One layout means one dashboard serves all of
them, and a reviewer who knows one product knows where to look in the next.
*Check:* `tests/test_pages_layout.py`

**ONE USE CASE, ONE FILE** *(PO A. Maier, 2026-09-23)*
Each use case is a single Markdown file named `docs/use-cases/UC-<nnn>-<slug>.md`.
*Occasion:* a file is the unit git versions, diffs and hashes. One use case per file makes each
one separately editable and separately acceptable.
*Check:* `tests/test_usecase_fields.py`

**ACCEPTANCE IS A COMMIT IN GITHUB** *(PO A. Maier, 2026-09-23, reworded 2026-09-24)*
A use case or a SPEC change is accepted by a commit, made under the accepting person's own GitHub
account, that adds an approval record to `docs/approvals/`.
*Occasion:* git already records who decided, when, and on which text. Whether the commit is made
by the dashboard with the person's token or in GitHub's web interface changes nothing about that
record.
*Check:* `tests/test_approval_records.py`

**AN APPROVAL NAMES THE EXACT TEXT** *(PO A. Maier, 2026-09-23)*
An approval record names the file it approves and the git blob SHA of the text the reviewer saw.
*Occasion:* "accepted" is meaningful only together with which text. A blob SHA identifies that
text exactly and can be recomputed by anyone from the file.
*Check:* `tests/test_approval_records.py`

**STATUS IS DERIVED FROM THE RECORDS** *(PO A. Maier, 2026-09-23)*
A reviewed file counts as accepted exactly when an approval record names its current blob SHA.
*Occasion:* a stored status drifts from the text it describes. Derived, an edit after acceptance
returns the file to review by itself, and nobody has to remember to reset anything.
*Check:* `tests/review-core.test.mjs`

**THE REVIEW DASHBOARD HOLDS NO CREDENTIAL** *(PO A. Maier, 2026-09-23 — withdrawn 2026-09-23)*
*Withdrawn:* private product repositories cannot be read without a token. Replaced by
`THE REVIEW DASHBOARD USES THE TOKEN ONLY TO READ`. The name is not reused.

**THE REVIEW DASHBOARD USES THE TOKEN ONLY TO READ** *(PO A. Maier, 2026-09-23 — withdrawn 2026-09-24)*
*Withdrawn:* accepting and editing are now one click on the dashboard, which writes with the
person's token. Replaced by `THE DASHBOARD WRITES ONLY ON A PERSON'S CLICK`. The name is not reused.

**THE DASHBOARD WRITES ONLY ON A PERSON'S CLICK** *(PO A. Maier, 2026-09-24)*
The dashboard writes to a repository only as the direct result of a person's action on it, as a
commit made with that person's own token.
*Occasion:* every write stays attributable to a person and a decision; nothing is written in the
background, on load, or on someone else's behalf.
*Check:* `tests/review-core.test.mjs`

**WITHOUT A TOKEN, GITHUB'S WEB INTERFACE IS THE FALLBACK** *(PO A. Maier, 2026-09-24)*
Without a stored token, accepting and editing open GitHub's web interface with the commit prepared
as far as GitHub allows.
*Occasion:* a reviewer who does not want to store a token can still decide; it costs more clicks,
not the ability.
*Check:* `tests/review-core.test.mjs`

**EDITS ARE PREPARED ON THE DASHBOARD** *(PO A. Maier, 2026-09-23, reworded 2026-09-24)*
The dashboard offers an editor with a live preview for a reviewed file, and saving commits the
edited text under the person's own account.
*Occasion:* reviewing and correcting belong on one screen. Copying text into GitHub's editor was
five actions for one decision.
*Check:* `tests/review-core.test.mjs`

**NO TEXT TRAVELS IN A URL** *(PO A. Maier, 2026-09-23)*
A link that prepares a commit in GitHub carries at most a file path and an approval record, never
the reviewed text.
*Occasion:* measured 2026-09-23: a link prefilled with 6 KB of text sent a logged-out reviewer
through GitHub's login redirect, which answered HTTP 500.
*Check:* `tests/review-core.test.mjs`

**AN ACCEPTED SPEC CHANGE IS WRITTEN BY A WORKFLOW** *(PO A. Maier, 2026-09-23)*
Once an approval record for a SPEC change is committed, a GitHub Actions workflow replaces the
anchored SPEC section with the approved proposal text byte for byte.
*Occasion:* the reviewer approves a proposal file; copying it into the SPEC by hand would reopen
the question of whether the approved text arrived verbatim.
*Check:* `tests/test_apply_approvals.py`

**A STALE APPROVAL IS NOT APPLIED** *(PO A. Maier, 2026-09-23)*
The workflow writes nothing when the proposal or the current SPEC section differs from the blob
SHAs named in the approval record.
*Occasion:* the reviewer decided on one proposal beside one current text. If either changed after
the decision, the decision does not cover the new state.
*Check:* `tests/test_apply_approvals.py`

**AN INSTANCE IS A FORK OF AGENT M** *(PO A. Maier, 2026-09-23)*
A person or team runs Agent M as their own fork, and the fork's Pages site is the dashboard for the
products that instance manages.
*Occasion:* every user then has their own dashboard, their own settings, and their own browser
storage origin; nothing is shared with the author's instance or with other readers.
*Check:* `tests/test_instance_target.py` — the dashboard derives its own repository from the Pages
address it is served from.

**A MANAGED PRODUCT NEEDS NO PAGES SITE** *(PO A. Maier, 2026-09-23)*
A managed product keeps its artifacts below `docs/` in its own repository and is reviewed through
the instance's dashboard, never through a site of its own.
*Occasion:* one dashboard per instance, one place to keep up to date. The artifacts stay with the
product's code; the tool stays with the tool.
*Check:* no automatic check; at review.

**THE INSTANCE LISTS ITS PRODUCTS IN A FILE** *(PO A. Maier, 2026-09-23)*
An instance names the product repositories it manages in `docs/products.md` of its own repository.
*Occasion:* the list is then the same in every browser, changes by commit like everything else, and
a reviewer sees which products an instance manages without any settings.
*Check:* `tests/test_products_register.py`

**ONE CLICK PER DECISION** *(PO A. Maier, 2026-09-24)*
A decision a person makes on the dashboard — accept, save, add a product, release — takes one click
once its inputs are complete, and everything that follows from it is done by Agent M.
*Occasion:* PO, 2026-09-24: "Too much clicking kills our user experience." Each extra step between
a decision and its effect is a place to get lost.
*Check:* no automatic check; at review of each use case.

**EVERY STEP EXPLAINS ITSELF** *(PO A. Maier, 2026-09-24)*
Every step that asks something of the person carries an explanation that can be expanded, written
for someone new to GitHub.
*Occasion:* PO, 2026-09-24: users "might be new to GitHub". The explanation stays folded for
those who do not need it.
*Check:* `tests/test_step_explanations.py`
