// kinds.mjs — the descriptors of the reviewed kinds this module shows (MOD-review-pages, Data): one record for each kind, which
// the one review flow in flow.mjs is driven by. ITM-355 builds the descriptor of the use cases, ITM-440 those of the architecture decisions and the module files.
//
// Module: MOD-review-pages

// ReviewKind { kind, route, entry, title, plural, noun, record, explain } — `kind` is the kind MOD-approvals gives a reviewed
// file; `route` the first part of the address's fragment; `entry` the menu entry; `record` the identifier-and-title heading of
// a file, from its text; `explain` the topics of the folded "What is this?".
const heading = (body) => /^# (.+)$/m.exec(body)?.[1] ?? "";
const explain = { list: "accepting", all: "accepting", one: "accepting", changed: "edit-after-acceptance", fallback: "github-page-without-token" };

// `restsOn` marks a kind whose file names what it rests on (a decision its forces, a module what it realises): its page shows the
// section of what is not accepted yet, and offers no Accept while there is any.
