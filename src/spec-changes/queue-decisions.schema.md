# The decisions of a SPEC change queue

The schema of a change queue's `entscheidungen.md`, in MOD-documents' schema language: the format that
MOD-spec-changes' file states under Data. Append-only: one row per decision, added by the apply workflow, never
changed. The table stands under the file's own title, with no heading of its own (`{ "underTitle": true }`), and has
no header row — MOD-documents' own illustration of a table without a header row is this very file.

What the language cannot say is written where it applies:

- A row's third cell is `uebernommen`: a decision row is written only once an entry is accepted, so there is no other
  decision yet.
- A row's fourth cell, `Reference`, names the approval record that was accepted: `approval:<file name, under
  docs/approvals/>`. A row of an earlier, retired form — a bare commit SHA, its time with no `UTC` — names no record
  a caller resolves by this schema's columns alone.
