# The counter-proof record

The schema of a counter-proof record `docs/tests/counter-proofs/TST-<nnn>.md` on the product's default branch, in
MOD-documents' schema language: the format that MOD-result-records' file (`docs/architecture/MOD-result-records.md`)
states under Data. It enters with the test's pull request, written by the participant that wrote the test
(`A NEW TEST IS SHOWN TO FAIL ON A PLANTED FAULT`); its body holds no title line, the text after the front matter
beginning directly with `## Fault`.

- `outcome` is always `failed`: a test that stays green with its fault planted is not written (MOD-result-records.md,
  Data).
- `## Fault` and `## Result` name no `fields`/`table`: MOD-documents reads their raw text — the file and the change
  planted into the code the test guards, as a difference, for `## Fault`; the test's failing result with the fault
  and its passing result once the fault was removed, for `## Result` — and MOD-result-records reads them itself, as
  MOD-job-ledger's schema leaves `## Destinations` and `## Parameters` to its own module to parse
  (`src/job-ledger/job.schema.md`).
