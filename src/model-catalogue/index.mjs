// MOD-model-catalogue — process models and practices as data, and their validation (docs/architecture/MOD-model-catalogue.md):
// its interface. Of it, ITM-215 builds what UC-002 needs: Model, Catalogue, catalogue, modelSchema and modelFindings, and the
// shipped catalogue as data — the book's models in models/ and its practices in practices/, each file naming the chapter
// it follows. ITM-229 adds a model's `## About` and Model.about: what UC-002 shows beside each model. ITM-258 adds reading
// a kind's explanation in parentheses in a phase's Produces, and a stated Time box of none as no time box. planGrid and
// modelDiagram are not built yet.
//
// Module: MOD-model-catalogue
//
// It belongs to Process (ARC-042). It runs unchanged in a browser and in Node. When it is loaded, it reads its own data files
// once: its two schemas, model.schema.md and practice.schema.md, in MOD-documents' language; its list of shipped files,
// shipped.md; and each file the list names — from the disk in Node, from the module's own address in a browser. A browser
// cannot list a folder: the list says which models and practices the module ships, and its code names none of them (THE
// CATALOGUE IS DATA). A file that cannot be read, or a schema that breaks the language, stops the module's load, as
// MOD-documents' file says of a broken schema. The instance's own models it reads through the snapshot its caller gives.
// Nothing is written. It uses MOD-documents and MOD-text-tools only through their index.mjs. Every other file of this folder
// is private to it.

// Schema and Document, in the types below, are MOD-documents' types of those names; Finding is MOD-text-tools', and
// Snapshot MOD-repository-hosts'.
