// The rules of a process model definition that a schema cannot express (MOD-model-catalogue, Parts: validate.mjs;
// Interfaces: modelFindings): a phase's own produced kinds against the kinds of artifact the module knows, since a
// phase's Produces may follow a kind with an explanation in parentheses that no type of the schema language sets apart
// from it; those that compare one part of a definition with another — the phases its transitions, verification pairs and
// gates name; the phases reached from the first one; the roles its phases and gates name; the kinds of artifact a gate
// checks against those its phase and the phases before it produce —; and the flow control of pulled work, a stated Time
// box of none read, before it reaches here, as no time box.
//
// Module: MOD-model-catalogue
//
// It compares the parts of a definition as index.mjs reads them from a document of the model's schema, each with the line
// it stands on — a phase's produced kinds already read with an explanation in parentheses dropped, and a Time box of none
// already read as null. What the schema decides — a value left out where it is required, a value not of its type, a
// measure that does not fit the kind of work, a missing declaration of planned or pulled — MOD-documents' documentFindings
// names, and nothing here names it twice: a part that is left out is compared with nothing. Every finding is an error on
// the line of the part that causes it, made with MOD-text-tools' finding.

 * validate(parts, kinds) -> Finding[] — the findings of the rules a schema cannot express, in the order of the parts:
 * - a transition naming a phase that is not defined, and a phase that no transition reaches from the first phase, along
 *   transitions of any kind (THE MODEL DETERMINES THE PHASES AND THE GATES);
 * - a verification pair naming a phase that is not defined (THE MODEL DETERMINES THE PHASES AND THE GATES);
 * - a phase naming a role the model does not define, which leaves it without a role (A PROCESS MODEL ORGANISES PEOPLE AND
 *   AGENTS);
 * - a phase producing a word that is no kind of artifact the module knows, an explanation in parentheses after it already
 *   dropped by index.mjs (THE MODEL DETERMINES THE PHASES AND THE GATES);
 * - a gate whose decider is neither a role of the model nor `check: <CI check name>`, which leaves it without a decider
 *   (A GATE NAMES WHO DECIDES IT);
 * - a gate that checks a kind of artifact which neither the phase it follows nor any phase before it — along the
 *   transitions that are not `back` — produces (A GATE NAMES WHAT IT CHECKS);
 * - pulled work that names neither a time box nor a work-in-progress limit, or both (A MODEL DEFINITION IS VALIDATED
 *   BEFORE IT IS USED), on the line of its ## Flow control, or on line 1 without one.
