// checks.mjs — watchForAcceptance: the checks of one page (docs/architecture/MOD-notifications.md, Interfaces, Data).
// Every minute, whether a check is due: the switch on, the browser's permission granted, and this browser's last
// check five minutes old or older, or never run — so that a page opened after a pause checks at once (UC-047 2a). A
// due check reads the snapshot of the default branch of the instance and of each product this browser keeps, each
// with its own host — the instance's as the frame connected it, a product's connected here with its own token, which
// goes only to its own server (A TOKEN GOES ONLY TO THE SERVER THAT ISSUED IT) —, takes from each what waits for
// acceptance with waitingForAcceptance, and compares it with what was notified: up to three of one kind in one
// repository notified one by one, more than three by one notification of their number; the first check after the
// switch is turned on (`checked` still null) records what waits then and notifies nothing (A PERSON IS TOLD WHAT
// WAITS FOR THEIR ACCEPTANCE). A repository that cannot be read is skipped until the next check, its entries in
// `notified` kept as they were (UC-047 2c). Each repository's default branch is read once per page and its host kept
// for the page's whole life, so that a blob already read is not read again (MOD-notifications, Data; MOD-repository-
// hosts.repositoryInfo).
