// MOD-approvals — approval records and the status of reviewed files (docs/architecture/MOD-approvals.md): its interface.
// Of it, ITM-233 builds approvalSchema, the approval record's schema, and statuses, the status — open, accepted or
// changed — of every reviewed file of a snapshot from one pass over docs/approvals/ (status.mjs). statusOf,
// lastAcceptedText, acceptShown, acceptanceBlockers, fallbackAcceptLink and approvalStrategies are not built yet.
//
// Module: MOD-approvals
//
// It belongs to Specification and design (ARC-041). It runs unchanged in a browser and in Node. Its one read is that of
// its own data file approval-record.schema.md — the approval record's schema, in MOD-documents' language —, once, when
// the module is loaded: from the disk in Node, from the module's own address in a browser. A schema that cannot be read,
// or that breaks the language, stops the module's load, as MOD-documents' file says of a broken schema: it stops that
// module, never a single document. statuses reads nothing itself: it is given a snapshot already held in memory (every
// path and every blob SHA of the tree), and derives status from the records' own names, matched by identifier
// (MOD-identifiers.kindOfIdentifier) — it never reads a record's text, and nothing here crosses the network. It uses
// MOD-documents and MOD-identifiers only through their index.mjs. Every other file of this folder is private to it.

// Schema, in the type below, is MOD-documents' type of that name; Snapshot is MOD-repository-hosts'.
