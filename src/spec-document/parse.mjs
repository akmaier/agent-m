// The SPEC read in its form (docs/architecture/MOD-spec-document.md, Data): its title, its sections with their byte ranges,
// and its requirements, each with its name, its source and that source's items, its rule, its check and the paths of the
// tests the check names, its section and its line. ITM-214 builds it; index.mjs offers it as parseSpec.
//
// Module: MOD-spec-document
//
// Pure: it reads only the text it is given, keeps nothing, performs no input or output, and never throws on content. What a
// requirement constrains is not read here, since no line of a SPEC states it: it follows from the SPEC the caller read — the
// instance's own SPEC holds the requirements on the development process, a product's SPEC those on the product. The reading
// of head lines follows docs/assets/artifacts/requirements.mjs (parseRequirements), which reads the SPEC's earlier form.
